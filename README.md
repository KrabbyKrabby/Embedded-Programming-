# STM32F446RE Embedded Programming

## Overview

This repository contains C implementations for fundamental embedded programming tasks on the STM32F446RE microcontroller. The projects include Blinky, USART, I2C, and SPI, each showcasing the practical application of C in programming this microcontroller.

## Implemented Features

### 1. **Blinky**
   - **Description:** The Blinky project demonstrates a basic LED blinking pattern. This is often the "Hello World" equivalent in embedded programming, serving as an initial test to ensure the microcontroller is functioning correctly.

### 2. **USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)**
   - **Description:** Explore the world of serial communication with USART. This project demonstrates bidirectional communication between the microcontroller and an external device, such as a computer, using the USART protocol.

### 3. **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**
   - **Description:** Delve into the I2C protocol with this project. Learn how to establish communication between the microcontroller and I2C-compatible devices, facilitating data exchange in a master-slave configuration.

### 4. **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**
   - **Description:** The SPI project demonstrates the use of the Serial Peripheral Interface for communication. Witness how the microcontroller interacts with SPI-compatible peripherals, exchanging data in a master-slave architecture.
